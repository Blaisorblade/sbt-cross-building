This version adds several features simplifying cross-building even further:

 * extra source directories (e.g. `scala-sbt-0.11` and `scala-sbt-0.11.2`) for adding
   compatibility code for particular sbt versions
 * `^^`-command to set the sbt version to build against in the sbt shell (like `++` in sbt)
 * `^`-command which runs a task each of the versions from `crossSbtVersions` (like `+` in sbt)
 * support for building 0.12.0-Beta2 plugins from an sbt 0.11.x build
