This version adds support for (cross) building plugins from an sbt 0.12 build and enables
scripted tests in cross-built plugins.

Improvements:

  * Add support for scripted tests by depending on the scripted plugin and fix incompatibilities
    to work in a cross-build setting

    To use it in you build:

      - remove the `plugins.sbt` dependency on the scripted plugin
      - in your build replace `scriptedSettings` with `CrossBuilding.scriptedSettings`

  * Allow building 0.12 or 0.11.x plugins from sbt 0.12

  * Allow building 0.12 plugins from sbt 0.11.x
