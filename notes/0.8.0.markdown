This version adds support for sbt 0.13.

Important: Starting with this version you have to add `crossBuildingSettings`
to your configuration. This was changed to adhere to the best-practices which
helps in multi-module projects where you don't want to enable sbt-cross-building
for all subprojects.

All changes and fixes:

  * [#15][]: don't mess with public settings when project is no sbt plugin
  * [#22][]: don't deliver broken ivy.xml with `publish-local`
  * [#14][]: use the latest scripted-sbt runner (0.13.0-RC3 for now) for all sbt versions. This
    allows to use the latest features of the runner when building for older sbt versions (though, you
    now need to run sbt with the sbt 0.13.x launcher because of jline incompatibilities).
  * [#16][]: allow `scriptedLaunchOpts` for all sbt versions
  * [#21][]: allow targeting sbt 0.13 from previous versions
